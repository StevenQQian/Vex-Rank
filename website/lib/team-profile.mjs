 * season it answered in about 0.45 seconds. The page shows one season at a
 * time, so it asks for that season and fetches others when they are picked.
 *
 * A scoped response still lists every event, so the season picker is complete
 * from the first one; rankings, awards, skills and the rating history arrive a
 * season at a time, and `loadedSeasonIds` says which. The iOS app does the
